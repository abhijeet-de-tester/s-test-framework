This is proposed to be a simple test framework. Allowing me to practice the concepts I learn along the way.
One important functionality that this framework should aim at is a solution for screen to screen comparison.
Built in Java, so one that could be integrated with any other Cucumber-TestNG-Java framework or test automation
implementation.

Basic Design:

Screen A --> Capture Data from Screen A --> Store it in an excel
Screen B --> Capture Data from Screen B --> Store it in an excel
Compare the two excels
Show resulting differences as highlighted areas on Screen A and B
